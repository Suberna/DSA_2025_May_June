package Array;
/*âœ… Problem Summary:
You're given an array nums[] of length n, which contains all numbers from 0 to n, except one missing number.
Your job is to find the missing number.

ðŸ§  Simple Logic (Using Sum Formula):
All numbers from 0 to n should add up to:
total = n * (n + 1) / 2
If you subtract the sum of elements in the array from this total, you get the missing number.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Works?
The array has n elements, but the full range is [0, n], which includes n+1 numbers.
By calculating the expected total and subtracting the actual total, you get the missing one. */

    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {

        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += num;
        }

        return total - sum;
    }
